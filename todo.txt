join
  broadcast new player to socket
  reflect new player having joined on other clients' game-state

player_changed_direction
  shove onto socket; JSON rep of that player's location when they changed direction, and the now-changed-to direction
  broadcast from server to socket "send" socket.broadcast.socket.send
    relay message to all clients other than the initiator - who has already updated their own rendered view
  update own rendered view
  when client receives player_changed_direction from server
    should have a JSON message with the player-state, which has the new state of the player that changed

BUG 2
When join button is clicked more than once, control toggles onto other player and speed is increased (2x messages, then 3x messages, etc)

BUG 3
When player is moving, the other players see it, but the moving player's direction isn't rendered - as in, he's still pointing north
